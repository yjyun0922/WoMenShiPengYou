#For generating the graph: 
## you can just put the path to your label file and then run count_how_many_before.py or count_how_many_after.py depending on which dataset you want to visualize

#For using the dictionary to get the string value for the input label: 
##refer to the png file how_to_use_dict.png
##This was created so that when you look at the histogram you can know which string name the number label is referring to without referring to the list of categories

#New files: 
##new files include 
###list_category_img_before.txt 
####which is the file that all of us should fill out 
###list_category_cloth_after.txt
####which is just a list of our new categories and the corresponding number labels
###list_category_cloth_before.txt
####Made a slight change to this; changed the numbers 1, 2, and 3 to the label numbers.
